=== Issue getter doesn't work in nested object
- solution to solve this is using dummy function and return value using object
- eg:

    @Expose()
    @Transform(({obj}) => (obj as SceneAction).action.value)
    value() {}

=== Issue un-initialize nested object
- Solution to solve this issue is re-arrange the class
- sub class must declare on top of parent class
